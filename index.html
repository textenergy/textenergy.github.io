        <h2>US Citizenship Test Preparation <span class="heading-arrow">▶</span></h2>
        <p>The USCIS has mandated the use of a new 128-question test for citizenship, but has not provided updated study materials in Spanish. To address this gap, the questions are provided with English and Spanish content, including audio so that learners can hear how the questions sound. (Spanish audio is provided as an alternative way for Spanish speakers to understand the questions if reading is not their preferred learning method. Also, for those who are old enough to take the test in Spanish as their native language, this provides a way to study the 25 key questions that they need to know.) <span class="fake-link">Explore the study materials.</span></p>

            <p>Additional materials based on the USCIS 2025 Civics Test Study Guide "One Nation, One People" will help learners understand where in the Study Guide they can find the content on which the new 128-question test is based. USCIS has made some minor changes to the 2008 version of the Study Guide, but there is no link from the Index to the pages of the chapters to assist the learners. These materials will address the gap and make the Study Guide more useful for 2025 test preparation.</p>
