Explorations in bilingual English/Spanish learning materials and related UI
I tutor Spanish speakers in English for general conversation, specific work-related vocabulary and US citizenship preparation. My resources are intended to be functional HTML sets with supporting CSS and minimal JS to provide interactivity. Anyone will be welcome to download the HTML to use for developing their own materials aor just use them online as is.
