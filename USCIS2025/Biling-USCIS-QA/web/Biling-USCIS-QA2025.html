        <h2>Bilingual Study Aid for 2025 Citzenship Questions</h2>
		<p>Each of the 128 questions and answers from the 2025 Citzenship test is presented with the English text and audio clip first. 
		This is because the English test is required of most people who apply for US Citizenship. Audio was synthesized from the English text.
		In this bilingual resource, the Spanish text has been translated from the English unofficially, 
		because USCIS had not provided a Spanish-language resource. Audio was synthesized from the Spanish text.</p>
		<p><b>This set of resources is not offical USCIS content.</b> Everyone who uses this set of study materials should refer first to the 
		official website for the Citizenship test study materials on this webpage 
		<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/study-for-the-test?/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/study-for-the-test?page=1">Study for the Test</a>. 
		There are offical PDFs of the English test questions and the Study Guide that you can download from the USCIS page.</p>
		<p>To understand the relationship between the questions and the Study Guide, please use the cross-reference provided with these materials, 
		<a href="Self-study resources.html">Self-study Resources for the New Citizenship Test</a>.</p>
