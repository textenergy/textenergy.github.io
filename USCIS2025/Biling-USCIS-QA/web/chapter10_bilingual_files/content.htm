Landowners depended on enslaved people to do the work.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the U.S. gained more territory, many people who owned slaves in the South wanted to move to the new states and territories in the West. They wanted to find more land to grow crops like cotton, corn, and tobacco. They also wanted slavery to be legal in the West so they could bring enslaved people to work on the farms and grow crops.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most northern states passed laws against slavery, and many people in the North did not want slavery to be legal in the West. When people from the North and the South began moving west in the 1800s, there</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">were many conflicts about whether slavery should be legal in the new states and territories. Congress began to pass laws that said where slavery was legal in the West and where it was not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Picking cotton on a Georgia plantation.

For example, Frederick</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Douglass escaped from slavery and became an important civil rights leader in the 1800s.

The states in the North were also afraid that the Southern states wanted to make slavery legal in the whole country.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Civil War started in 1861 after 11 states in the South left the United States and tried to create their own country. They called their country the Confederate States of America. The states in the North were still called the United States of America.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Civil War Battle of Antietam.
